AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS CHALLENGE
Codeflix Introduction
Welcome to Code Challenge: Aggregate Functions!

A streaming video company, Codeflix, needs your help analyzing their user data. We’ve imported a portion of their dataset into the SQL workspace for this lesson.

The database contains 3 tables:

users contains the basic account details for each user
payments contains payment details for a 3 month period
watch_history contains watch events for the users

AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS CHALLENGE
Code Challenge 1
The users table has the following columns:

id
first_name
last_name
email
password

Instructions
1.
Use COUNT() and a LIKE operator to determine the number of users that have an email ending in ‘.com’.

SELECT COUNT(*) AS count
FROM users
WHERE email LIKE '%.com';

Instructions
1.
What are the most popular first names on Codeflix?

Use COUNT(), GROUP BY, and ORDER BY to create a list of first names and occurrences within the users table.

Order the data so that the most popular names are displayed first.
SELECT first_name, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM users
GROUP BY first_name
ORDER BY count DESC;

The watch_history table has the following columns:

id
user_id
watch_date
watch_duration_in_minutes

Instructions
1.
The UX Research team wants to see a distribution of watch durations. They want the result to contain:

duration, which is the watch event duration, rounded to the closest minute
count, the number of watch events falling into this “bucket”
Your result should look like:

duration	count
1.0	9
2.0	21
3.0	19
…	…

Use COUNT(), GROUP BY, and ORDER BY to create this result and order this data by increasing duration.
SELECT
  ROUND(watch_duration_in_minutes,0) as duration,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM watch_history
GROUP BY duration
ORDER BY duration ASC;

The payments table has the following columns:

id
user_id
amount
status
pay_date
Click here for the table diagram.

Instructions
1.
Find all the users that have successfully made a payment to Codeflix and find their total amount paid.

Sort them by their total payments (from high to low).

Use SUM(), WHERE, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY.

SELECT user_id, SUM(amount) AS amount
FROM payments
WHERE status = 'paid'
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY amount DESC;

The watch_history table has the following columns:

id
user_id
watch_date
watch_duration_in_minutes
Click here for the table diagram.

Instructions
1.
Generate a table of user ids and total watch duration for users who watched more than 400 minutes of content.

Use SUM(), GROUP BY, and HAVING to achieve this.

SELECT
  user_id,
  sum(watch_duration_in_minutes) AS time
FROM watch_history
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING time > 400;

The payments table has the following columns:

id
user_id
amount
status
pay_date
Click here for the table diagram.

Instructions
1.
Which days in this period did Codeflix collect the most money?

Your result should have two columns, pay_date and total amount, sorted by the latter descending.

This should only include successful payments (status = 'paid').

Use SUM(), GROUP BY, and ORDER BY.

SELECT pay_date AS day, SUM(amount) AS total
FROM payments
WHERE status = 'paid'
GROUP BY day
ORDER BY total DESC;

The watch_history table has the following columns:

id
user_id
watch_date
watch_duration_in_minutes
Click here for the table diagram.

Instructions
1.
Of all the events in the watch_history table, what is the duration of the longest individual watch event? What is the duration of the shortest?

Use one query and rename the results to max and min.

SELECT
  MAX(watch_duration_in_minutes) AS max,
  MIN(watch_duration_in_minutes) AS min
FROM watch_history;
