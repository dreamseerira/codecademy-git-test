Delete a Key
You are designing the video game Big Rock Adventure. We have provided a dictionary of items that are in the playerâ€™s inventory which add points to their health meter. In one line, add the corresponding value of the key "stamina grains" to the health_points variable and remove the item "stamina grains" from the dictionary. If the key does not exist, add 0 to health_points.

Get All Items
