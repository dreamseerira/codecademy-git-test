Count Letters
unique_english_letters(word)

Instructions
1.
Write a function called unique_english_letters that takes the string word as a parameter. The function should return the total number of unique letters in the string. Uppercase and lowercase letters should be counted as different letters.

We’ve given you a list of every uppercase and lower case letter in the English alphabet. It will be helpful to include that list in your function.
