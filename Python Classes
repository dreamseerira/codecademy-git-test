In script.py you’ll find our familiar friend, the Circle class.

Even though we usually know the diameter beforehand, what we need for most calculations is the radius.

In Circle‘s constructor set the instance variable self.radius to equal half the diameter that gets passed in.

Checkpoint 2 Passed
2.
Define three Circles with three different diameters.

A medium pizza, medium_pizza, that is 12 inches across.
Your teaching table, teaching_table, which is 36 inches across.
The Round Room auditorium, round_room, which is 11,460 inches across.
Checkpoint 3 Passed
3.
Define a new method circumference for your circle object that takes only one argument, self, and returns the circumference of a circle with the given radius by this formula:

circumference = 2 * pi * radius
Checkpoint 4 Passed
